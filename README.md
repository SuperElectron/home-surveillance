# Home Surveillance System

## Description
This project is provides a basic home surveillance system that connects to IP cameras on a fixed local network.
The videos from IP cameras are sent to a media server where they are recorded (HLS) and periodically backed up (local or cloud).
You may view the cameras by logging in to Ant Media Server (the video server) to check out what things look like at home.

To monitor the health of the system (device monitoring), a visualization stack with Kafka messaging fabric has been installed.
The device monitoring system may also be viewed with a GUI to show any interruption to the camera streams, downed devices, and so more.
